Vinnie helps you rip vinyl

Usage ex:
vinnie foldername

Vinnie relies on mutagen to first check the given folder for FLAC files, then confirm all FLAC files are 24-bit, next the metadata of the files is ready to set the folder name to:
"Artist Name - Album Name - Release Year - [24-Bit FLAC]"

Finally, Vinnie prompts you for audio equipment information in order to create a lineage.txt file which it adds to the new folder. Defaults can be set for this file so you can just press enter for each prompt.
